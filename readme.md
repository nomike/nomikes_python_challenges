This repository contains a growing number of python challenges, to help absolute beginners to start programming.

# How to start

# Operating system & Visual Studio Code
I recommend to use Ubuntu (either installed directly on your computer or within WSL (Windows Services for Linux) and visual studio code (vscode). You can install vscode from the Microsoft Store or the Ubuntu Software Center.

If you are using Windows (version 10 or above) you can install WSL and Ubuntu by opening a command window (right click on the start menu and chose "Command Prompt" or "Windows Power Shell"). 

In there type

```
wsl --install
```

and press return.

This will setup WSL and download and install Ubuntu. You might need to reboot your computer afterwards.
