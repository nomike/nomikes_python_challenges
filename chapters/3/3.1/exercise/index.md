# Chapter 3.1 - Exercise

[TOC]

## Getting help

Python has a builtin help system which describes and explains things:
In an interactive python session you can use `help()` on almost anything to display a help page:

```python
help(len)
Help on built-in function len in module builtins:

len(obj, /)
    Return the number of items in a container.
```

***Note:** The help page is opened using the `less` command. Refer to [chapter 1.2](../../1/1.2/) if you are unsure about how to navigate it (hint: Try the cursor keys and "q").*

## Planets

Copy this into an interactive python session:

```python
planets = ["Mercury", "Vinus", "Mars", "Earth", "Saturn"]
```

## Fix the planet name

"Vinus" has a typo in it and should be called "Venus". Fix this by replacing the element.

## Sort the planets

Your objective is to sort the list of planets alphabetically and print it to the terminal.

***Hint:** The list of planets might have a function for that. Use the builtin help, to figure out how to do that.*

## Reverse the planets

Print the list of planets in reverse order.

## Remove planets

Remove the one planet from the list, where humans, as of 2023, already have set foot on.

## Length of a string

How long is the string "The quick brown fox jumps over the lazy dog"?
