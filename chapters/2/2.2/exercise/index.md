# Chapter 2.2 - Exercise

[TOC]

## Be more friendly

Your goal is to extend the [hello world program](hello.py.txt) to be more friendly. Instead of greeting the whole world, it should ask the user for their name and greet them specifically. The program should be stored in a script and executing it should look like this:

```plaintext
Please enter your name: nomike
Hello, nomike. Nice to meet you!
```

## Calculate the sum of two values

After greeting the user, the program should ask them to input two numbers and it should print the sum on the screen:

```plaintext
Please enter a number: 4700
Please enter another number: 11
The sum of those numbers is 4711.
```

## Solution

When you're done, you could compare your code with the [solution](solution.py.txt).
Does your code look similar? Does it produce the same results as the example above?

## Invalid input

For now this simple program could not handle invalid user input. Try inputting text instead of integers when asked for numbers.

This requires more complex code and I will show you how to make your code more resilient in a later chapter.

But let's have a look at conditions now, which are the main topic of [chapter 3](../../../3).
