# Chapter 2.2 - Exercise

[TOC]

## Be more friendly

Your goal is to extend the hello world program to be more friendly. Instead of greeting the whole world, it should ask the user for their name and greet them specifically. The program should be stored in a script and executing it should look like this:

```plaintext
Please enter your name: nomike
Hello, nomike. Nice to meet you!
```

## Calculate the sum of two values

After greeting you, the program should ask you to input two numbers and should print the sum on screen:

```plaintext
Please enter a number: 4700
Please enter another number: 11
The sum of those numbers is 4711.
```

## Solution

When you're done, you could compare your code with the [solution](hello.py).
Does your code look similar? Does it produce the same results as the example above?

## Invalid input

For now this simple program could not handle invalid user input. Try inputting text instead of integers when asked for numbers.

This requires more complex code and I will show you how to make your code more resilient in a later chapter.

For now let's have a look at conditions which are the main topic of [chapter 3](../../../3).
